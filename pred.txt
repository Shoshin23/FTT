@jahanbakshi It was more the showy, Oscar-baiting aspect of Redmayne's recent performances, I was thinking especially of his Danish Girl act
Randeep Hooda acts his heart out, but "Do Lafzon Ki Kahani" is a missed opportunity for a four-hankie weepie... https://t.co/vNtCijxHf7
@jahanbakshi Disagree. The films themselves aren't affected. They the very definition of bland, Oscar-baiting sap.
@jahanbakshi I know. It didn't come out right. Was trying to say he plays the part very casually (unlike Redmayne, who's always affected)

@engineerology @beastoftraal @TheHindu So not the point. @beastoftraal was asking why this piece did not happen when Kapil Sharma happened.
@beastoftraal @TheHindu I am not a regular Kapil Sharma watcher. But the point being is valid whether it's made in this context or that one.

@ThePuccaCritic Sendhoora poove *is* by Ilayaraja.

“Who says village love can be expressed only by dholi or shehnai?” https://t.co/kWU05rGmAI 40 years ago, Sendhoora poove had the same logic.
@netrakanti71 @the_hindu Because pieces are always edited by the desk. If you read carefully, you'll also see some sentences are different.
@miSuyog I agree. It's just an easy (rather, lazy) word to use on twitter, one word that can club together non-hindi languages.

@shashi_vsky @chhabs Did you just spoil the film for me? Of kareena kapoor turns up as a ghost, I'm going to be very upset :-)
Also, Sairat is a great example for why regional industries should subtitle their films and look beyond traditional Gopal-palpodi markets.
Not denying that. But the base material -- that's what I'm talking about.
Of course, the film takes it to another level by fusing an Alaipauthey angle and a lot of great directorial/writing/acting touches...
@wothadei @turvytopsy I'm sure. And many others (tamil film watchers) would have pointed it out as well had it been released in Chennai.
Sairat is fantastic, but before raving about its never-before-ness, do see Balaji Sakthivel's Kadhal, even if the Dalit angle isn't explicit

@prudhviraj87 In the sense that birdman is closer to being john malkovich, taking a singular thing about an actor &amp; creating a conceit of it
@prudhviraj87 Really hard to do this on twitter :-)
@prudhviraj87 but this is more of a career trajectory, filled with signature moments. I'd call birdman more of a biopic-fantasy.
@IraKannan Not really. At least not right now. Though as I said, that would be a very interesting exercise.
